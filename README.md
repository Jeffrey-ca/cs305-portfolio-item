Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to increase security into their preexisting application. I was able to diagnose the security vulnerabilities and fix them by updating the version of the dependencies. It's important to code securely to avoid data leaks and other exploits that could harm the users of the application. Strong software security adds peace of mind when it comes to private information. The vulnerability assessment was useful because it pointed to where exploits could happen and where existing exploits have been found. It's also nice because it includes ways to some of the existing exploits.
